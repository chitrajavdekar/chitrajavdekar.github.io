## About me

Hello! Welcome to my website. I am currently serving as Dean of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math at MassBay Community College. I earned my PhD in Civil Engineering from Tufts University in 2004.

I am passionate about teaching, mentoring and writing about poignant issues in my professional field.
In my free time, I enjoy gardening.
