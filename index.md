## About me

Hello! Welcome to my website. I am currently serving as Dean of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math at MassBay Community College. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil (Structural) Engineering from Tufts University in 2004.

I am passionate about teaching, mentoring, and writing about current issues in my professional field. I lead with empathy and care. 
In my free time, I enjoy gardening.
